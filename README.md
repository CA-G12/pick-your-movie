## 📍 User journey

- When the user first opens the our web application, he/she will find a header component, the header component includes a logo, a search bar to search movies by, an `X` icon to empty the search bar, a search icon to do the search functionality when it is clicked.
- Then the user will find a container that holds all the movies cards that appeared after the search or the default data we give when no search action is done.
- When the user use the search bar and start typing, an autocomplete box suggestions will be shown below the search bar.
- Every movie card contains the poster of the movie, the name of the movie, the rate of the movie, and the categories of the movie.
